# Proposed Implementation – DLMM Strategy Templates Gallery + Marketplace

## 🔹 Overview

We propose building a **web-based application** on top of the Saros DLMM SDK that serves two user groups:

1. **Newcomers** – guided onboarding via pre-made strategy templates and an educational simulator.
2. **Advanced users** – full-featured strategy builder, analytics, and a community marketplace to share or monetize strategies.

  - Creator (if marketplace template)
- Actions: **Preview in Simulator → Deploy**

### 3. Simulator

- Interactive price slider linked to DLMM bins.
- Visualization:
  - Bins shifting as price changes
  - Live updates for IL%, ROI%, fees estimate
- Actions:
  - Save config as **Custom Strategy**
  - Deploy to DLMM pool

### 4. Deploy Flow

- Wallet connection (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack).
- Confirm parameters (bin ranges, token allocation).
- Execute via **DLMM SDK** transaction:
  - `createPosition()`
  - `addLiquidityToBin()`
- Show transaction status & position summary.

### 5. Portfolio Dashboard

- Displays active positions & strategies.
- Key metrics:
  - ROI
  - Impermanent Loss
  - Fees collected
  - Active bin status
- Alerts:
  - Position exited bin range

- Actions: **Edit / Close / Rebalance**

### 6. Strategy Builder (Advanced)

- Form-based creation of strategies:
  - Bin ranges
  - DCA intervals
  - Stop-loss / Take-profit rules
  - Rebalancing frequency
- Preview in Simulator before publishing.
- Save as **Template JSON config**.

### 7. Marketplace

- Community hub for sharing strategies.

## 🔹 Architecture

### Frontend

- Framework: **Next.js / React**
- Visualization: **Recharts / D3.js** for simulator & bin charts
- Wallet integration: **Solana Wallet Adapter** (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack)

### Backend

- Strategy storage: **PostgreSQL / Supabase** (templates, user configs, marketplace data)
- Notification service: Telegram / Email alerts for IL risk
- Marketplace logic: free vs paid templates, ratings, leaderboards

### On-chain Integration

- **Saros DLMM SDK (TypeScript)** for:
  - Fetching pool & bin data
  - Creating positions
  - Adding/removing liquidity
- Future expansion: **Rust DLMM SDK** for backend automation

## 🔹 Roadmap

### MVP (Hackathon Scope)

- Templates Gallery (3 default strategies)
- Basic Simulator (price slider + bin visualization)
- Deploy flow with wallet connect
- Portfolio dashboard (active positions + metrics)

### Mid-term

- Strategy Builder (custom bin configs + rules)
- Marketplace (publish & import templates)
