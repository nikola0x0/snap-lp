# Saros DLMM Demo Challenge - 4-Day Sprint Plan

## Strategy Templates Gallery MVP

**Bounty**: $1,500 USDC total prizes (1st: $500, 2nd: $400, 3rd: $300)  
**Deadline**: ~4 days remaining  
**Target**: Build production-ready MVP that stands out from 15+ submissions

---

## üéØ Winning Strategy

**Core Advantage**: While others build basic dashboards or simple bots, we're creating a **template-based LP platform** that eliminates the complexity of DLMM setup - directly addressing the "difficult for newcomers" pain point. The name is "SnapLP".

**Differentiation**:

- One-click strategy deployment (no manual bin configuration)
- Pre-optimized templates with proven parameters
- Interactive simulator for strategy preview
- Production-ready UI/UX that judges can actually use

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **DLMM SDK Issues**: Start with SDK integration Day 1, have fallback mock data
- **Wallet Connection Problems**: Test multiple wallets, provide clear error messages
- **Deployment Issues**: Deploy early Day 3, have backup hosting option

### Scope Risks

- **Feature Creep**: Stick to core MVP, resist adding "nice-to-have" features
- **Over-Engineering**: Use pre-built components where possible, focus on working demo
- **Time Management**: Set hard cutoffs for each section, move to next if stuck

### Competitive Risks

- **Similar Ideas**: Focus on execution quality and educational angle
- **Late Submission**: Finish 6 hours early to handle unexpected issues
- **Demo Quality**: Ensure live site works perfectly, not just locally
