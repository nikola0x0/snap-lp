# DLMM Strategy Templates Gallery + Marketplace

## 🎯 Problem

- DLMM is powerful but **difficult for newcomers** to understand (bins, ranges, rebalancing).
- Professional LPs want to **optimize and monetize** their strategies, but there is **no structured platform** to share or showcase them.
- Without better tooling, DLMM adoption risks being limited to only advanced developers and traders.

---

## 💡 Solution

A **two-sided product** that serves both new and advanced users:

### For Newcomers

- **Templates Gallery**: ready-made strategies (Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive) deployable in one click.
- **Simulator**: interactive visualization showing how bins shift with price changes, plus estimated IL, fees, and ROI.
- **Confidence Builder**: users preview outcomes before deploying real capital, lowering entry barriers.

### For Advanced Users

- **Strategy Builder**: design custom DLMM bin configurations, rebalancing rules, DCA, stop-loss, and take-profit logic.
- **Marketplace**: publish strategies for others to use (free or paid), with rankings, ROI leaderboards, and reviews.
- **Analytics**: dashboards with risk alerts, ROI tracking, and cross-pool optimization tools.

---

## 🚀 Value Proposition

- **Newcomers**: simple onboarding, education through simulation, easy first deployment.
- **Advanced users**: deeper control, monetization of expertise, and data-driven optimization.
- **Saros**: transforms DLMM from an SDK into a **platform** for innovation, adoption, and community growth.

---

## 🔑 Differentiation

- Goes beyond basic dashboards or bots → builds a **strategy ecosystem**.
- Combines **education + execution + monetization** in one unified product.
- Directly leverages DLMM mechanics (bin placement, liquidity provisioning, fee generation).

---

## 📌 One-Liner Pitch

> _“We turn DLMM into a strategy marketplace — where newcomers learn and deploy instantly with templates, experts share or monetize their strategies, and Saros grows an ecosystem around dynamic liquidity.”_
